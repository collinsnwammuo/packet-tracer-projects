##  🎯 Objective

This repository contains a curated collection of Cisco Packet Tracer labs designed to demonstrate practical networking skills, including routing, switching, VLAN implementation, IP addressing, and security configurations. These projects simulate real-world enterprise environments and showcase proficiency in designing, configuring, and troubleshooting computer networks.

##  🧠 Skills Demonstrated

Network topology design & documentation

Router and switch configuration (Cisco IOS CLI)

Routing protocols: OSPF, EIGRP, RIP

VLANs, trunking & inter-VLAN routing

Subnetting & IP address planning

ACLs, DHCP, NAT & Layer 2 security

Troubleshooting using simulation mode & PDU analysis
